Common Cartridge Playground
---------------------------

This is a place where we are playing with updating / adapting some
cartridge reading software that was part of the educommons.com effort.
This effort stopped in 2012 - it was Python 2.0 and Plone based.  As
best I can tell this melted into some combination of Canvas Commons
and/or Lumen Learning and was abandoned.

It is over 12 years old and needs a lot of updating but it makes
a good playground.  We might end up starting over but there seems to
be a lot of good here.
